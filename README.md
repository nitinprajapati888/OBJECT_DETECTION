# OBJECT_DETECTION
A project of python in journy of ML/AI
## Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python
OpenCV dnn module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow.

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are

YOLO
SSD
Faster R-CNN
Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently.

Dependencies
opencv
numpy
pip install numpy opencv-python

Note: Compatability with Python 2.x is not officially tested.
